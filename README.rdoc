Listmaker is a tool customized for technology news website Tech in Asia(http://www.techinasia.com) to create list articles while minimizing the need to do manual formatting in HTML. The app uses data from Wordpress, Google Analytics, and an article summarization API.

Everyday, Listmaker scans Tech in Asia for articles and stores them in a database. The app extracts a summary and number of pageviews for each article.

The app presents users with either markdown or HTML code which they can use for an article. It also has an interface to curate stories into a formatted list article within Wordpress.
