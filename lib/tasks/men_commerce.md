Men hate to shop. A new breed of Singapore startups wants to turn that into an advantage.

Men around the world let out a cathartic sigh when [_Miserable Men_](http://instagram.com/miserable_men) went viral on Instagram. The account depicts bored men (and their poor sons) waiting at shopping malls for their wives and girlfriends. It highlights an inescapable reality: women love to shop, and for a really long time. Men, out of love and respect, provide miserable company.

Ecommerce has blessed men, since it frees them from waiting while still giving women instant gratification. But fashion ecommerce in particular still largely accommodates the ladies. In the US, women's apparel sales grew to US$111 billion, compared to US$58.6 billion for men. So ecommerce sites naturally gravitate towards the female set.

But that is changing. A new crop of startups now see the once abandoned group as a segment that's ripe for the taking.

Contractors 

MR Q. textile printer. graduate printer. London. Menwear’s brand as well. graduated in graphic design. sold in belgium and london. moved here in 2012.

met at Zalora. menswear’s designer for zalora private label. 

switzerland. tailoring something ex. here it’s 70 to 80 bucks. men like conveinecen. go back and you buy the same design. a business suitable for ecommerce. once you get that cut right. make it convenient to select different color and type. men are lazy shoppers. make it convenient. indochino. 

measure yourself. not very convenient. conversion killer. simply that. getting the first shirt completely right. once we have your measurements, push to ecommerce.

250 Swiss. 310 SGD. 150 pounds. cheap cos access to cheap supply. lower production costs. lower margins.

made sense to start here cos we’re based here. closed to manufacturing base. 

control the whole backbone. collection. QC. Logistics. build sales forces in other countries. once the manufacturing is set up. collection is ready. systems are here. there’s no reason why you should contain yourself to one market. Plug and play. copy paste model.

7 people in the company. 4 full-time outfitters.

ex to get outfitters. but saving on other ends. zalora needs warehouse. inventory. money tied out. working with manufacturers who have a lot of stock. saving on that end. cost of sending somebody out is a little bit higher. cheaper to get outfitters to sell. we employ our staff much better than somebody who sets up a shop. corporate sales. 

trumaker: direct sales model. people work on freelance, commission basis. we want people on board first to control. later on to have a lot of freelance outfitters.

3x as high as zalora. chino pants. suits to be added. accessories. ties. pocket squares. Suits > $700.

shirts interesting thing we see is men shopping behavior. people stock up a little. stock up again. we have people that immediately do four five shirts with us. do one shirt first then do the rest. 

2.5 to 3 shirts on average. 3 to 4 shirts.

founder of tate and tonic was also at zalora. 

started off he had this amazing office space. we moved into the office where they were. moved out cos exceeded capacity. looking for new office. they looked together with style tribute. office too big for two of them. Stephanie from P&G.

synegy. Q has design background. madeo has online marketing. information sharing. tate and tonic. selling to men.

same delivery couriers. negotiate as one. style tribute team has photo studios.

will have to hold inventory at some point. suppliers lead us so far. want to do casual shirts. chino cottons. these things will require us to have inventory

compare to traditional ecommerce, need to forecast different sizes or colors. if you get that wrong. have to manage with steep discounts. for us we just need fabric. inventory risk is lower.

19 March. so far personal professional network. 

corporate sales. half a day or a day set ourselves way. OCBC. Aberdeen asset management. Banks. Financial institutions. they’re the main consumers.

corporate sales and direct reach out as customer acquisition. ecommerce as repeat.

50% m on m.

Standard Chartered Good Life app.

seeing a lot of repeat cycles. renewal cycles is a bit long. won’t come back so soon. 

men are lazy shoppers. but they’re loyal shoppers. until something dramatically happens. women’s market is temperamental.

if you convince them you’re brilliant. great service counts. but fit and fabric. fitting process is crucial.

if you speed things up, things may go wrong. as thorough as possible. you gain their loyalty. that’s when the LTV multiplies.

Self funded for most of the ride. First angel invetors. Roger and Vikram. Sergei Nessin INSEAD professor. five figures in the bank. committed six figures.

Raising seed round.

UK after Singapore.

size of market. number of financial institutions. establishment of tailored groups. a lot of physical shops. but no outfitter model.

JD.com targeted men, but added women in. Women tend to spend a lot more, while men spend more per item. Women shop in bulk, men go for what they want. mass commerce targets women. cash fashion. price sensitivity. rapid fashion cycles. chicken or the egg?

Matteo. regional marketer. joined after a couple of months after they launched.

regional marketing there for 8 different countries. stayed there until the end of the year. 2012.

before that was in italy started my first coy. digital marketing agency. wanted to leave the country. received offer by zalora. rocket internet. knew they were pretty good at starting up. pretty sure I’m not gonna stay there long. learn as much as possible. stayed there learned as much as possible. by the end of the year started to think of new idea. wanted to leverage the vertical the knowhow. it goes pretty fast, a lot of areas I wanted to go into. 

why fashion: as a consumer i’ve always been interested in rseaerching brand. mainly from the customer’s perspective.

from a biz perspective while in zalora i learned that there are many challenges of many flows in the traditional ecommerce model. damn hard to make profitable. even if you have millions and millions of funding. the way those flows could be improved.

developing a model that’s structurally more efficient.

Tate & Tonic more efficient?

1) from a customer acquisition perspective. cost of acq customer in traditional ecommerce is very high, esp in the beginning. online retail has lowest retail and fashion lowest among sectors. sizing component. this dramatically impacts your conversion rate. translate to higher acquisition cost and lower profitability. we lower the barriers to entry. you don’t have to pay upfront. you don’t have to commit before trying on the products. we are way more efficient than marketing. ours is a biz where customers were they stick more to the service. after each product we deliver we know more and more about the customer. you incentivize the customer to buy from us. 

2) inventory management. a lot of write down and aging inventory. people sell at massive discount. impacts dramatically your profitability. makes whole biz very capital intensive. in our case by having so much data about each customer. deciding ourselves what to push to customer. we have way better tools to plan our inventory buying. being more efficient. buying less comparing to traditional ecommerce. higher cross-margin profitability.

Tate & Tonic data: before ordering a box, each customer has to go through a questionnaire. how we dress at work. leisure time. pricing point. brands. fitting. measurements. occupation. after you receive first batch. subsequent times you receive something. 4 days to try everything. fill up return form online. on each product if you don’t keep, have to tell us why. these reinforce our understanding of customers. 

if you push product to a customer. you don’t want to try it. 

if you receive it at home. you will buy it this time. higher conversion rate. 

on a per box basis yes intense. two way delivery. the thing is when customers buy more than one item. average basket we have is higher than what zalora have. the cost of logistics is higher on a per customer basis but lower on a per revenue basis. 

5,000 customer mark. Users that went through the final step of customer. in terms of growth, top down growth more than 6 months 20 percent month on month in volume and revenue.

since april last year controlled growth mode. we decide before beginning of the month which is the growth we want to achieve we’re getting more demand than what we can fulfill. happiest problem to have. we have been working first on the inventory side. to set up the right operation and scale it. in general ecommerce is operation intensive. ours especially is pretty challenging. assemble the box. we’re working on operation and buying side.

closed seed round in March beginning of this year. syndicate of local and international angel investors. 300,000.

Why men? 

What I thought was that the pain and the hassle of shopping traditional way was higher of men. there are fewer women percentage wise that enjoy the online experience. Receiving more and more requests from women. Girlfriends and wives of the customers. When we check on the mentions on social media. We often see comments asking if this service is available for women. Pretty sure it could work for women.

Singapore only. A few months ago we ran a marketing test across SEA. Thailand. Malaysia. HK. From a marketing perspective. Reaction in terms of user acq was pretty good. Convinced potential in wealthier more stab markets like Korea, Australia. It’s not a short-term strategy. there’s still a lot to accomplish here in SG> work on many areas of the biz before we can expand. 

returns? Really varies. Customers sometimes buy a jackpot. Cases when you buy half box. Sometimes one. Sometimes none. In most of the cases when they don’t buy anything they require another box. if we don’t get right the first box the customer will just go away and don’t come back. the whole experience is so easy and convenient. 

choose date and time.

share the same logistic partner. aCommerce. Give us the flexibility. 

a few months ago did logistics ourselves. weaned to be flexible. but we’re not a logistics company. not as important for us as say redmart. 

managing freelance drivers and smaller logistics provider. the problem is logistics is a biz that is driven by economies of scale. the small the company, the more flexibility they might give you the higher of cost. 

aCommerce. not all providers. give the chance to have the timeslot. they are available to do after-hours delivery and collection. we have a pretty direct them. if something goes wrong. reschedule. can immediately contact our account and driver. 

daily basis the impact of what you do based on what i do  Isee what happens o na customer business everything. zalora i couldn’t really see. even if the position was important and impactful. hundreds of other people. if you build something you cannot blame anyone else.

building thing from scratch. i don’t know how to explain or rationalize the feeling. from a simple laptop table at starbucks you can build something is something that really fascinates me.

deciding and building the team culture that you want. in this case biz is challenging. when you are so constrained it’s not that easy. every entrepreneur will really believe in building the best culture. if ou are so constrained it’s so easy to make sure that everyone is happy. or nicest smartest guy. 

most rewarding part about Tate & Tonic. feedback from a customer. not just creating a fancy service no one cares about. you are making thousands of customers life a little bit easier in that regard. that’s the huge reward. for the first four months I was the one doing the deliveries directly ourselves. Smoove cars. that way I could talk directly with customers. when i was get feedback when collecting box. 

famous quote about Paul Graham from YCom. At the beginning one of the most beginning try to build something that scale.e build something that don’t scale. 

the airbnb guys went door to door taking pix of listings.

Packnada


- percentage men?
- why men?
- men psyche
- traction and funding
- pricing? target audience?
- customer acq cost?
- future plans?
- profit margin?
- women prefer to wear different clothes. might not want packnada.

beta was launched in december last year. 

why men is particular?

when we wanted to do packnada we didn’t have men specifically in mind. the idea was for luggage free travel. combined storage and clothes. were on a biz trip ones and we had a really long airport queue. if we didn’t have check in luggage we wouldn’t have to do all these things. by-product.

men are less picky about their outfit. 

number one thing would be that men value convenience more. point that resonates most with the guys that speak to. value convenience. natural. 

99 USD. we first started off by looking at retail laundromat. we started looking at hotel laundry which is what biz travelers. charge quite highly. we definitely have to be cheaper than these guys though we are more comprehensive. needed to price ourselves lower. 99 usd. half of these same amount of clothes at hotel.

keeping cost down?

the hotel prices are quite inflated with. biggest cost will come from laundry. laundry partners are large scale.

30 to 40 percent (OTR). Leeway when we work with incumbents. work out a revenue share with hotels. working with partners. spoken to 2 or 3. MBS. offer their guests discounted.

logistics of getting bag into the room. don’t need an explicit partnership. drop at concierge. so and so guest checking in tomorrow. used to all these years.

launched last month. 100 beta sign ups. didn’t have much publicity. we do have paying customers, just not big enough to talk about.

got started with the SPRING grant. met our milestone. give two years.

ACE Startups.

not actively fundraising. priority now is still marketing. getting Singapore right.

no confirm plan. haven’t examined in detail. US is 100x bigger. China is 250x bigger. Indonesia is a huge opportunity. 

emailing and asking us.
